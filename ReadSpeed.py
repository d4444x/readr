(me and the sysop)if you went to grade school in the 1980s or 90s, chances are good you were publicly offered drugs at school by a uniformed police officer.hey, he might have said, want to meet up behind the gym after school and get high?luckily for you, you were savvy enough to understand that this wasnt an earnest offer. it was an exercise in resistance.no thanks! youd say. i have homework to go do.come on, hed retort. impressed with your delivery, hed decided to step up the simulated peer pressure. i thought you were cool.not doing drugs is cool, was your reply.your classmates might have applauded, at the officer/teachers prompting. then you went back to your seat, and the officer would go over the things you did well in the exercise, so the class could learn by your example. in addition to teaching the other students, the officer was also building up your self esteem.self esteem and resistance were two major cornerstones of the drug abuse resistance education program, also known as dare. through the 1980s and the 1990s, dare swelled from a tiny local program to a massive, and massively expensive, national campaign against drugs in schools. at its peak, dare was practiced in 75% of american schools, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to run. it had spiffy, 90s branded swag, and a baritone-voiced mascot, daren the lion.there was just one problem: dare didnt work.students who went through dare werent any less likely to do drugs than the students who didnt. in fact, theres some well-regarded research that some groups of students were actually more likely to do drugs if they went through dare.scientists knew dare was ineffective relatively early on, but the program grew anyways. the programs eventual reform was the result of a long and hard battle between evidence-based research, and popular opinion.dares humble beginningsthe original officer dare: dares founder, lapd chief daryl gates, later became infamous for his handling of the rodney king riotsdare got its beginnings in the city of los angeles in the early 1980s. daryl gates, the la police department (lapd) chief of police, helped create the program, and became its first figurehead. the story goes that when gates noticed that the number of drug busts on school campuses was increasing, he had the idea to focus on preventative education instead of punishment. as gates told the l.a. times in 1993:"we had 'buy programs' in the schools where undercover officers would buy drugs from students. we kept buying more and more. it was appalling, depressing. i finally said: 'this is crazy. we've got to do something.' "the lapd, in conjunction with the local rotary club and the la unified school district (lausd), came up with the drug abuse resistance education program, dare (also, incidentally, a pun with chief daryl gates first name.)dr. ruth rich, the districts health education specialist, was tasked with selecting the first curriculum. research on drug prevention education was already underway at usc, under the title smart. but there was a catch -- gates wanted dare to be taught by police officers themselves, not doctors or teachers. rich agreed with him, on the grounds that cops are more familiar with criminal culture. as she told the la times, "theres a gap between the street and the classroom. police officers are believable on this subject. when it comes to drugs, they're more credible than a teacher."the idea of police officers in the classroom turned off some of smarts original authors, including the head of the research team, andy johnson. reason magazine reported, though sympathetic to rich's dilemma, johnson had serious objections to handing an experimental educational program over to the local police.without johnsons oversight, rich took the smart curriculum and patterned her own off of it. in 1993, there were two main versions of smart: one that focused on developing personal goals and self esteem, and another that focused on resisting things like peer pressure and advertisements. rich combined the two approaches.a dare course taught by naval officerswhen the school opened in september 1983, the lapd took to the classroom to both teach kids about the dangers of substance abuse, boost their self-esteem, and help them practice just saying no (a la nancy reagan). within a few years, dare was a regular fixture in la schools. by the mid-nineties, it was a national organization with multi-million dollar annual revenue.the program was popular among parents and students from its inception. it was also popular among politicians and bureaucrats, who saw dare as a way to be proactive about, the drug problem. from the reason magazine:"[people were] eager to find an easy solution to the problem of juvenile drug abuse. dare became 'a rallying symbol to do something positive about the drug abuse problem.'"this political status carried dare far. in 1986, the national institute of justice (nij) published the first independent review of dare, reporting that the program had short-term results. although it drew criticism from the scientific community, dare earned nij funding as a result of the study. dare also soon won a $140,000 grant from the department of justice to expand the program to the national level. and congress passed the drug-free schools and communities act of 1986, which set aside 10% of state grants to governors for police-staffed, in-school, drug education programs, and mentions dare by name.like that, dare became a national, nationally funded movement. in 1988, u.s. presidents started recognizing national dare day, a practice that continued into the obama administration. by 1992, the drug-free schools and communities act money accounted for almost $10 million nationally. by 1995, dare estimated its own costs at $200 million.dare vs. the research, ithis pencil thing actually happened.that first independent review of dare, which found that it had an effect on drug use, quickly started to look like an extreme anomaly. by 1991 there were already more than a dozen published studies claiming that dare had absolutely no measurable effect on drug use. this negative finding proceeded to bear out through another two decades of research.this came as no surprise to the social scientists behind dares original curriculum, the smart program. a few years after dare started, the usc researchers made an alarming discovery about smart: early versions of the program didnt work. in fact, some of them had a boomerang effect, by which participation correlated to higher rates of drug use. but by the time of this discovery, the lausd had grown distant, according to smart researcher, bill hansen. hansen and johnson claim they reached out to dare to help revise the curriculum, but were rejected.what they took was the prototype, hansen has said, we went through thirty versions of the curriculum, so a lot of the stuff they lifted was antiquated, in our view.the problem was that, to a lot of people, it seemed like common sense that dare would just work. everyone believed that if you just told students how harmful these substances and behaviors werethey'd stay away from them," frank pegueros, the current president and ceo of dare. america, has said.this deep-seated, folksy belief in dares ability to combat a publicly reviled problem gave it a decades-long stranglehold on the american education system. ''we suspect that there are gaping holes in the program and that it may not be cost-effective, but legislators are politicians,'' a legislator told the new york times in 2004, on the condition that his name not be used. ''no one's going to risk their political future by doing anything other than standing up with the parents. parents vote.''drug use in high schools went down nationally in the 1980s and early 1990s. some people who observed this trend in their local community might have misattributed it to dare. (via krusekronicle)some of the battle between dare and its scientific critics played out in public. research was met with anecdotes, or with pleas that the program was changing too fast for studies of old curricula to be relevant, or that dare was so widespread, its effects so particular, that it couldnt be tested. "i don't have any statistics for you. our strongest numbers are the numbers that don't show up, a dare official once told a newspaper. dare supporters would regularly accuse critics of being in bed with drug cartels, or selfishly interested in taking over the drug resistance education industry. negative media would inspire letters to the editor, supporting the program and calling for more funding.dare executives often pointed to the programs popularity as evidence of its credibility. as glenn levant, the former lapd officer who directed dare in the early 1990s, told the la times in 1993, "knocking dare is like kicking your mother or saying that apple pie doesn't taste good.he went on, for 10 years, i've been living and breathing dare, and it's all been about helping kids. that's our program, and that's what we're going to keep on doing.dare vs. the research, iithe nij commissioned a study from the prestigious research triangle institute, and then refused to publish itthere was also a behind-the-scenes battle that played out between dare and scientific research. while dare was doing its best to publicly combat and distract the scientific naysayers, they also tried to silence critics before they reached the public spotlight at all.in the early 90s, the nij hired the research triangle institute (rti) to do a meta-analysis of the existing evaluations of dares efficacy. in 1994, rti concluded the study, announcing that dare had no measurable effect on drug use, and that other, existing programs, seem to do better. dare could be improved, and if it refused to improve, it could be replaced. from the studys conclusion:"dares limited influence on adolescent drug use behavior contrasts with the programs popularity and prevalence. an important implication is that dare could be taking the place of other, more beneficial drug use curricula that adolescents could be receiving."then, despite positive peer review, and despite the fact that the nij had closely reviewed the study throughout its development, the nij refused to publish the results. they did not elaborate on their refusal, beyond claiming the work did not meet their, high standards of methodological rigor. the nij then issued a press release, reporting on the unpublished study, including the positive findings that dare is popular, and growing, and omitting the claims of ineffectiveness.not only is dare widespread and popular, but demand for it is high," it read. "[dares] appeal cuts across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines [with] considerable support for expansion of the program."a dare class in 2005 -- 11 years after the rti paper was published (marion doss)when rti sought publication in an independent journal -- the american journal of public health -- dare pressured the journal against publishing. the journals editor, sabine beisler, told usa today, "dare has tried to interfere with the publication of this. they tried to intimidate us." the paper, which flew through peer review, was published anyways.the papers lead author commented on the fact that the concerns over methodological rigor were particularly problematic because the paper was a meta-analysis of existing research. rti did not conduct any new experiments. as they told reason:"the results of all the studies used in the meta-analysis were consistent; it's not like the conclusions of these different studies were all over the place. we did not find any support for [a statistically significant] impact on drug use, and they show dare has no effect at all on marijuana use."when asked how the nij reviewers refused an article that the american journal of public health reviewers uniformly appraised as first-rate, a dare spokesperson told reason, "it was hot and sexy for public health to criticize dare."makin it realhot and sexy or not, the rti study was by no means the last to find dare completely ineffective. no matter how researchers sliced it -- by observing students exposed to more up-to-date versions of the curriculum, or who had taken dare for multiple years -- they could not find any evidence that dare reduced drug use. there was some evidence that it temporarily improved students self-esteem, or gave them negative attitudes towards drugs. but there wasnt any evidence that it actually had an effect on the behavior it was supposed to target.but these reports themselves seemed ineffective at reaching the public in a meaningful way. nor were they effective at slowing dares growth. then, nearly 20 years after dare launched with a faulty curriculum, things started to change.in 2000, the department of education did an audit of drug education programs. only evidenced-based programs would be eligible for funding out of the department of educations drug education budget. dare did not make the cut.in 2001, the surgeon general did its own evaluation, concluding, "[d.a.r.e.'s] popularity persists despite numerous well-designed evaluations and meta-analyses that consistently show little or no deterrent effects on substance use."the flag of the government accountability officethen, in 2003, another government organization evaluated dare. this time, it was the government accountability office (gao) -- a federal watchdog on government spending of taxpayer money. gaos interest in dare was obvious. dare was funded with federal, state, and local taxes. in 2003, dares cost was estimated at between $200 million and $2 billion.gao selected six long-term evaluations for review -- studies that looked at kids 5 to 10 years after the dare program and evaluated its effect. all of the studies found no significant differences in illicit drug use, between the dare group and the control group. five of the six reported on students attitudes towards drugs and found, no significant differences between the [dare] and control groups over the long term.although gao left the detail out of its report, some of the research it included in its review found that dare had the dreaded boomerang effect on some students. as the authors of the original paper wrote, suburban students who were d.a.r.e. graduates scored higher than suburban students in the control group on all four major drug use measures.rocky andersonthe dare money finally started to ebb. cities and districts started shutting down their dare programs -- rocky anderson, as mayor of salt lake city, famously called the program a fraud on the people of america. threatened with extinction, the shrinking dare got serious about reforming itself into an evidenced-based practice. suddenly, they needed and wanted the scientific communitys help.it was state of the art when we launched it, levant said in 2001, when he announced the planned curriculum overhaul. now its time for science to improve upon what were doing.it might have been too little, too late. by 2010, dares revenue was $3.7 million, down from $10 million in 2002. it plunged into debt in 2009 and 2010.***keepin it real is dares long-awaited answer to evidenced-based programming.todays dare promotes an education program that has a stamp of approval from the substance abuse and mental health services administration. the replacement program, titled keepin it real, launched in 2011. its developers say its not an anti-drug program, but is more centered on decision-making skills, things like being honest and safe and responsible. but, unlike dare, its been demonstrated in a handful of studies to reduce the risk of drug abuse:the reports from students who completed keepin it real indicated that they sampled these substances less than those in a control group, and used a wider variety of strategies to stay sober. their antidrug attitudes were also more likely to stick over time.after two and a half decades of research, and the threat of extinction by defunding, dare is finally friends with science. its been a long hard road, but americas most popular drug resistance education program finally actually teaches kids to resist drugs.for our next post, we investigate

the new york times its a familiar story for meteorologists who have been calling for vast and attainable improvements in american weather forecasting for years.over the last few decades faster computers superior models and new data have allowed all weather forecasting to improve by a lot. but the united states hasnt quite matched that effort. it didnt invest in computing power and models that kept up with the potential for better forecasts.by early 2013 the european model had nearly 10 times the raw computing capacity of the global forecast system or g.f.s. which is run by the national weather service. there were other problems too and the cumulative effect was obvious and irrefutable the g.f.s. was doing worse than it rivals and it played out in high-profile cases like sandy. after hurricane sandy congress gave the national weather service the money for more powerful computers. in january 2015 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced that it had increased computing capacity and begun running an upgraded model with higher resolution a more detailed prediction.the upgraded g.f.s. prevailed over the european model in the blizzard that largely missed new york. many of the forecasts confidently calling for high snow totals in new york were banking on the european model or even outright disregarded the g.f.s. but despite its early victory the upgraded g.f.s. is still behind.the g.f.s. is still quite inferior said cliff mass a professor of atmospheric sciences at the university of washington. we are a clear third behind the european and british models. maybe theyve gotten one third of the way. continue reading the main story interactive map map of hurricane joaquins path the storm became a hurricane on wednesday. open interactive map additional upgrades which will culminate in a nearly tenfold increase in computing capacity will help more but simply upgrading computing capacity wont be enough to catch up. the problems run deeper all the way down to the description and modeling of the basic physics of radiation clouds precipitation and turbulence according to mr. mass. advertisement continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story perhaps the biggest shortcoming is in data assimilation the process of taking all of the available data and building an initial description of the atmosphere. the model runs from that but a perfect model of the wrong atmosphere will yield a wrong answer. it is clear that our initializations are inferior mr. mass argued. thats the real problem. they have a lot more people and have taken a more sophisticated approach. differences in initialization were probably at play in the different forecast for joaquin. theres a subtlety that the european center is getting right that were not.in a statement william lapenta director of the national weather services national centers for environmental prediction did not address differences between the american and european models.he observed that no single model is correct 100 percent of the time. the european models data assimilation relies on more observations than the g.f.s. including satellite measurements of radiation from clouds which is crucial in areas with relatively few land observations. it also assimilates the data over time allowing the model to start with the evolution of the weather heading into the forecast period not just a snapshot.the g.f.s. is making strides in this area but mr. mass says theres still a long way to go.maybe it will be joaquins false alarm not another

germany became one and by this it became a truly democratic country. the oppressive system of the german democratic republic gdr was ended and with it an immense surveillance apparatus disappeared. this is an extremely joyful moment to all germans yet it also has to remind us that we cant take the freedoms we currently enjoy for granted. more people living in the gdr know what it was like to be monitored 247 to say only what is appropriate. they remember the feeling of desperation all too-well when you disagree with the system but cant say a word for fear of negative consequences for you and your family. can you imagine how it feels like when you cant criticize your government no matter how unfair they rule?many of us living in modern democracies that value freedom of speech never had such an experience. we simply cant imagine what it is like to live in an oppressive system without freedom of speech. can you imagine how it is like when you cant criticize the ruling class even though they obviously privilege their fellow party members while discriminating everybody else? can you imagine how it feels like to watch bolder friends being denied any chance of promotion at work just because they criticize obvious discrimination? can you imagine how it feels like to join this exact same party when you grow older only to be allowed to go to university to sell your soul to it because this is the only way you are able to realize your personal dreams at least in parts? if you want to know how it feels like to live in a surveillance state you need to talk to people who did. you have to picture yourself living in a society where obviously a lot is going wrong but no one is allowed to speak up about this. you have to picture yourself submitting to the ruling class completely possibly becoming one of them despite of your own feelings and thoughts. only then you can get a hint on what it must feel like to be monitored and self-censored constantly. such a society limits your options to live and express yourself freely to an extent that it even effects your private life. freedom is the cornerstones of a democracy take it away and youll have another oppressive systemtoday in most western countries we enjoy many freedoms freedom of speech freedom to learn the occupation we want freedom to travel. we are so used to all these freedoms that sometimes only sometimes we need to be reminded of their importance. because if we lose these freedoms we lose everything. in an oppressive system based on mass surveillance there is no freedom left. while you were able to make yourself comfortable in this society by following the rules and supporting the oppressive system you were neglected one of the most basic human characteristics the freedom to choose what you think is right. the next oppressive system is already looming in front of useven though we in germany have left this oppressive system behind 25 years ago there is no guarantee that something similar will not happen again in any democracy anywhere in the world. actually the current political development in many western countries paints a very negative picture when it comes to our freedoms. currently many countries discuss to strengthen the online surveillance rights of their secret services also against their own citizens. some even go so far as to claim that encryption should be prohibited or backdoored. it is up to everybodys own imagination what a second cryptowar could do to our free societies but it is clear that it cant be any good. the interdependence of freedom of speech and our right to privacyfreedom of speech and our right to privacy are interdependent. one cannot exist without the other. in any system as free as it is you need to be able to discuss in private about any aspect of society and politics also online. only with a free private discussion people are able to form an opinion opposing the mainstream to argue their case so to speak. this is vital to democratic progress. taking it away from citizens will stop the democratic discussion and lead to self-censorship. some might argue that in a free democracy a private discussion is not necessary because of all the freedoms we enjoy. unfortunately this is not true. as free as we are in a democracy it is always possible that we are being discriminated for uttering our opinion particularly if it contradicts the mainstream. plus we can never be sure that our freedoms are to last. the german communists back in the 1930s did not foresee that they would be sent to concentration camps a few years later by hitler just because they wanted a different political system. the anti-communists in the gdr did not foresee that they would be sent to jail by the stasi ministry for state security just because they wanted a different political system. what is even more terrifying online surveillance is in so many ways easier and cheaper than what the stasi used to do to monitor their citizens more than 25 years ago. lets fight against surveillance online to protect our freedom of speech and our right to privacy!today 25 years after the end of the german surveillance state gdr online surveillance is all around us. our fight against surveillance needs to continue. many countries around the world increase the surveillance rights of their secret services or even try to ban encryption which is the only tool we currently have that can guarantee privacy while communicating online. even some german politicians seem to have forgotten about our own history and want to introduce a data retention law the only good aspect of this draft is that it explicitly excludes email from being monitored. this shows that our fight is far from over. we have to remind politicians and the public again and again that privacy matters. because our right to privacy is the basis for freedom of speech. and this is the cornerstone of a free democracy. without it we have lost everything that a democracy stands for. so lets keep on fighting and lets keep on encrypting. to take back our privacy one step at a time. our secure email service gives you an easy way to do so. we need you to fight for privacy!today is the day we call on all citizens of the world to keep fighting against surveillance. arne is co-founder and developer of tutanota. i fight for privacy because thats the cornerstone of freedom and democracy. posted on 2015-10-03 share navigate post list next comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus. en  bg  cz  da  de  fa  fr

both are weak low-frequency signals. theres no apparent reason for why it couldnt amplify emg if only a digital filter was used to suppress the mains hum. its a signal but its noise first a little disclaimer. its unwise to just plug yourself into a random electric circuit even if oona survived. mic preamps for example are not mere passive listeners instead they will in some cases try to apply phantom power to the load. this can be up to 48 volts dc at 10 ma. theres anecdotal evidence of people getting palpitations from experiments like this. or maybe not. but you wouldnt want to take the risk. so i attached myself into some leads soldered into a stereo miniplug using the home-made pads that i taped on opposite sides of my face. i plugged the whole assembly into the usb sound cards mic preamp and recorded the signal at a pretty low sampling rate. the signal shown here from 0 to 700 hz is dominated by a mains hum colored red-brown as i suspected. there is indeed a strong signal present during contraction of jaw muscles large green area. moving the jaw left and right produces a very low-frequency signal instead bright green splatter at the bottom. its fun to watch but still a bit of a disappointment i was really hoping for a clear narrow-band signal near the 65 hz frequency of interest. einthovens triangle at this point i was almost ready to ditch the emg thing as uninteresting but decided to move the electrodes around and see what kind of signals i could get. when one of them was moved far enough a pulsating low-frequency signal would appear could this be what i think it is? to be sure about it i changed the positions of the electrodes to match lead ii in einthovens triangle as used in electrocardiography. the signal from lead ii represents potential difference between the left leg and right arm caused by the heart. after i plugged the leads in the amp already did this looks promising! the mains hum was really irritating at this point but i could get completely rid of it by rejecting all frequencies above 45 hz since the signal of interest was below that. the result is a beautiful view of the iconic qrs complex caused by ventricular depolarization in the heart posted by oona risnen oona risnen labels biohack hardware signals older post  2 comments thinkfat02 october 2015 1549maybe thats not the right angle of approach?
